##### TODO 1: Construct your two different creatures
# Requirements:
#   1. For the basic parts of your creatures, feel free to use routines provided with the previous assignment.
#   You are also free to create your own basic parts, but they must be polyhedral (solid).
#   2. The creatures you design should have moving linkages of the basic parts: legs, arms, wings, antennae,
#   fins, tentacles, etc.
#   3. Model requirements:
#         1. Predator: At least one (1) creature. Should have at least two moving parts in addition to the main body
#         2. Prey: At least two (2) creatures. The two prey can be instances of the same design. Should have at
#         least one moving part.
#         3. The predator and prey should have distinguishable different colors.
#         4. You are welcome to reuse your PA2 creature in this assignment.
